MSMTools
=======================================

MSMTools is a Python library for the estimation, validation and analysis Markov state models.

It supports the following main features:

* Markov state model (MSM) estimation and validation.
* Computing Metastable states and structures with Perron-cluster cluster analysis (PCCA).
* Systematic coarse-graining of MSMs to transition models with few states.
* Extensive analysis options for MSMs, e.g. calculation of committors, mean first passage times,
  transition rates, experimental expectation values and time-correlation functions, etc.
* Transition Path Theory (TPT).

For a high-level interface to these functionalities, we encourage you to use PyEMMA.


Technical features:

* Code is implemented in Python (supports 2.7, 3.3/3.4) and C.
* Runs on Linux (64 bit), Windows (32 or 64 bit) or MacOS (64 bit).
